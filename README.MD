Scala Quant Lib
--------

This project is aimed at providing an native Scala adaptation of the popular C++ QuantLib project.
While trying to maintain the same function and concept of the original project, ScalaQuantLib will try to
incorporate conceptions and implementations from the functional world. Such changes will include but not limited to
Strong Type, Pattern matching, Functional reactive programming, Immutable date/time(aka JodaTime) and etc.

This project is still in early infancy, there are lots of bugs, missing documents and features, even missing test cases.
A full adaption of the original project will need helps from anyone whom believe in this project could be a welcomed
change to both the worlds of Scala and quantitative finance.
